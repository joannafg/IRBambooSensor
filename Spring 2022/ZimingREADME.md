## Arduino Folder 
I uploaded the my whole Arduino folder from my local drive on May 16, 2022. <br> 
220430_IR_sensor_Spiral_A2, sketch_mar01a, and sketch_may03b are bug-free and runnable. <br> 
220430_IR_sensor_Spiral_A1 does not run. <br> 
### sketch_mar01a 
The main file I have been using to get data from scanner. It outputs data to serial port. 
### sketch_may03b
The file I made to test library "AccelStepper.h"
### 220430_IR_sensor_Spiral_A1, 220430_IR_sensor_Spiral_A2
Both are adapted from .ino made by Ramtin, with some minor changes. 
## Java File 
This is the java file I used to extract the data from the text of serial port to clean .txt data file. 
## Ramtin H Folder 
This folder contains two files 220430_IR_sensor_Spiral_A2.ino, and 220430_IR_sensor_Spiral_A1.ino, both made by Ramtin H.
